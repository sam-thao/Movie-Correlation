# Movie-Correlation

This data analysis project uses Python and the Pandas library to study a movie industry dataset from Kaggle. The main goal is to find correlations in the data, which will give us insights into box office performance, genre trends, and audience preferences. By using Pandas' data manipulation tools, we hope to discover useful patterns that can assist movie industry professionals in making informed decisions.
