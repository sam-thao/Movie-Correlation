# Movie-Correlation


In this data analysis project, we use Python and the Pandas library to investigate a movie industry dataset obtained from Kaggle. The main goal is to discover correlations among movie budgets, gross income, and user votes on IMDb, shedding light on intriguing connections within the data. By delving into these relationships, we gain valuable insights into aspects like box office performance, genre trends, and audience preferences within the movie industry.
